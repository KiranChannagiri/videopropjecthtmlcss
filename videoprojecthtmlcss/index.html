<!-- `-webkit-text-stroke` is a CSS property that allows you to specify the width and color of strokes around text. It's primarily used in web development for adding an outline or border to text. The `-webkit` prefix is used for properties that are specific to WebKit-based browsers like Safari and Chrome. Here's an example of how you might use it:

```css
h1 {
    -webkit-text-stroke: 1px black;
}
```

This CSS rule would add a black stroke around the text of all `<h1>` elements on the webpage, with a width of 1 pixel. Keep in mind that `-webkit-text-stroke` is a vendor-specific property and may not be supported in all browsers. 
    WebKit is a browser engine, essentially the core component of web browsers, responsible for rendering web pages. It was originally developed by Apple for their Safari browser. WebKit-based browsers are those that use the WebKit engine as their foundation. Some of the well-known WebKit-based browsers include:

1. **Safari**: Developed by Apple, Safari is the default browser on macOS and iOS devices. It was one of the first browsers to use the WebKit engine.

2. **Google Chrome (before version 28)**: Google Chrome initially used the WebKit engine but later switched to its own engine called Blink. However, prior to version 28, Chrome used WebKit.

3. **Opera (before version 15)**: Opera also used the WebKit engine before switching to Blink in version 15.

4. **UC Browser**: A popular mobile browser, especially in Asia, UC Browser is based on the WebKit engine.

5. **Epiphany (GNOME Web)**: Epiphany, the default web browser for the GNOME desktop environment, uses the WebKit engine.

While the WebKit engine itself is open source, different browsers using it may implement additional features or optimizations specific to their platforms.-->
